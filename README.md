1. Tool Scope
Objective:

Create a Python tool that, when receiving specific keywords, returns relevant commands for CMD, PowerShell, or other useful tools for offensive cybersecurity tasks.
Initial Focus:

Windows user enumeration.
Gradually expand to include commands related to networking, services, files, and other common operations.
2. Modular Structure
Divide the tool into clear, maintainable modules. For example:

User Input: Captures and interprets the command.
Database: Stores and organizes the commands.
Search: Finds and returns the relevant information.
Display Interface: Formats and shows the results.
Maintenance: Allows adding or removing commands.
3. Database Design
The storage for commands should be simple but flexible. Here are some options:

Internal dictionary (initial phase): Start with predefined commands in a Python dictionary.
JSON or YAML (expansion): Move to external files for easy updates.
Example database structure (JSON):

json
Copiar código
{
    "enumerate windows user": {
        "cmd": "net user",
        "powershell": "Get-LocalUser | ft Name,Enabled,Description,LastLogon"
    },
    "list windows groups": {
        "cmd": "net localgroup",
        "powershell": "Get-LocalGroup | ft Name"
    }
}
4. Execution Flow
Here is an example of how the tool will work:

1. Input
User types: ENUMERATE WINDOWS USER.
Input is converted to lowercase to make searching easier.
2. Processing
The tool searches the database for the input.
If found, it returns the associated command(s).
If not, it shows a message like: "Command not found. Please check the available keywords."
3. Output
Displays the command(s) formatted for CMD and/or PowerShell.
Example:
vbnet
Copiar código
CMD: net user
PowerShell: Get-LocalUser | ft Name,Enabled,Description,LastLogon
4. Additional Options
Allow the user to list all available keywords.
Save the output to a text file if requested.
5. Future Features
Category-based searching:
Organize commands into categories such as Enumeration, Networking, Services.
Customization:
Allow the user to add commands to the database.
Usage Suggestions:
Provide context on how to use a command for learning purposes.
Automation:
Automate command execution directly in the terminal (optional and only for controlled environments).
6. Design Considerations
User-Friendly: Simple interface with direct responses.
Extensible: Modular database to add new commands.
Portability: Easy to use on any system with Python installed.
Security: Ensure that the tool does not execute commands automatically to prevent misuse.
7. Pending Tasks
Create the initial list of commands.
Include the most used Windows enumeration commands (users, groups, services).
Outline the basic code structure.
Decide on the storage format (internal dictionary or JSON).
Develop the basic search and display logic.
If you want, I can assist with creating the initial list of commands or start drafting the code structure!
